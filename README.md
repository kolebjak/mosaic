# Mosaic
* Environment: node v10.4.1, npm 6.1.0

## Challanges
* Usage of FileReader in Saga
* Problem with `react-scripts-ts test` script (automatically starting in watch mode and even the watch mode doesn't work correctly), so i used plain jest

## Gaps
* Image is stored into redux - this solution is slow if you want to store large image. 

## ​Areas​ ​for​ ​improvement 
* Loaders / spinners if something takes long
* Resizing image
